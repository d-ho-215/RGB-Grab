# RGB Grab

A python script to grab RGB values from points selected on screen, record a name for each selection, and output the results as a file (initially as GIMP Palette format for Inkscape).

This was partially cribbed from another scripts I found elsewhere... will need to look up where it was from.

Requires:
 - pyautogui
 - Pillow (PIL)

### todo
 - [ ] use custom header for GIMP format
 - [ ] output to other color format files
